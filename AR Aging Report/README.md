# **Accounts Receivable (AR) Aging Dashboard**

## **Introduction**
This report provides a comprehensive view of Accounts Receivable (AR) aging, leveraging the power of Power BI for visualization and AWS Redshift for data extraction and transformation. The report offers valuable insights into outstanding customer invoices, categorized by aging buckets, facilitating informed credit control, risk assessment, and collection strategies. Built on the combined strengths of Power BI and AWS, this AR Aging Report serves as a robust and insightful tool for effectively managing accounts receivable and optimizing cash flow.

## **Problem Statement**
Managing accounts receivable is critical for maintaining healthy cash flow and minimizing financial risks. However, without a centralized and dynamic view of AR data, businesses often struggle to:
- Track the status of outstanding invoices.
- Identify delinquent accounts and aging trends.
- Allocate resources effectively for collections.
- Make data-driven decisions to improve cash flow.
This report addresses these challenges by providing a clear, interactive, and real-time overview of AR metrics.

## **Design Process**
The overall design process I developed together with the data engineers in this project focused on creating a seamless and insightful AR Aging Report. While the data engineers primarily handled the data pipelines and ETL processes in AWS Redshift, I led the design and development of the Power BI report, ensuring it met the needs of stakeholders across finance, credit control, and executive leadership. This collaborative approach allowed us to deliver a robust and user-friendly tool for managing accounts receivable effectively.

### **Wireframing**
Using Power BI, I developed high-fidelity wireframes with interactive elements to simulate the user experience for key report pages and user flows. These wireframes focused on:
- Clear information hierarchy, especially in differentiating aging buckets and delinquency metrics.
- Intuitive navigation patterns, including filters and slicers for dynamic exploration.
- Strategic placement of key visuals (e.g., bar charts, tables, and KPIs) to highlight critical insights.


### **Visual Design**
The visual design approach centered on creating a professional and data-driven aesthetic that would appeal to both technical and non-technical users. Key elements included:
- A consistent color palette aligned with the organizationâ€™s branding, using color coding to differentiate aging buckets and statuses.
- Clear typography guidelines for headers, labels, and data points to ensure readability.
- Bookmarked tabs for ease of navigation around the report.
- Visual cues to distinguish between consolidated and project-level metrics.
